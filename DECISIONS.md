# Decisions

**What Thena decided, and what it means for you.**

Every noteworthy decision goes here — lexing, the type theory, the tactic
language, the session — whatever the layer. Two audiences, and they want the
same thing:

- **us**, so a decision is written down once instead of re-derived from the
  code;
- **you**, if you already know Agda, Coq, Idris or Lean and want to know what is
  different here before you start guessing.

It is not a tutorial and it is not a specification. It is the list of places
Thena made a choice, with enough of the reason to tell whether you would have
made the same one.

**Adding to it:** when a decision is made, add it to its section the same day,
under a heading that says the decision rather than the topic. Say what you can
and cannot write, and give the shortest example that shows it. Reasons are worth
one paragraph, not three; the argument lives in `.claude/`.

## Concrete syntax and lexing

### An identifier may contain almost anything

*Decided 2026-08-25; consequences accepted 2026-08-29.*

Most languages reserve a generous set of punctuation and give you the rest.
Thena does the opposite: it reserves as little as it can, so you can name things
in your own notation — `≼`, `Γ⊢`, `x'`, `2-cell`, `∂f/∂x` are all one identifier.

**Reserved, and nothing else:**

| | |
|---|---|
| brackets and separators | `(` `)` `{` `}` `[` `]` `;` `,` `"` |
| operator characters | `λ` `∀` `⊢` `≟` `≐` `≈` `▸` `⌜` `⌝` |
| whitespace | |
| keywords | `let` `in` `elim` `forall` `where` `rule` `when` `then` |

A name starts with an ASCII letter, `_`, or any non-reserved character above
ASCII.

**What follows, and it is the part that will catch you out.** `:` and `=` are
*not* reserved, so they can sit inside a name. The lexer takes the longest
match, so:

```
x:S          one identifier, called "x:S"
x : S        three tokens — this is what you want
x: S         two tokens: the identifier "x:" and then S
```

**Ascription must be spaced on its left.** In practice, space both sides and
you will never think about it again.

**ASCII digraphs need a space before them** — `->`, `:-`, `|>`, `[|` — for the
same reason:

```
Type₀->Type₀      one identifier, and "not in scope"
Type₀ ->Type₀     fine — a space after is not needed
Type₀ -> Type₀    fine
```

**The Unicode spellings never need one**, because those characters *are*
reserved:

```
∀ (x : Type₀)-> x     fine
```

**`rule`, `when` and `then` are keywords** and cannot be used as names. Op words
are not: `solve`, `type`, `goal` and the rest stay perfectly good identifiers,
which is why a rule is written `rule ‹name› :- when … then …` and not with the
op words reserved.

## The REPL and the session

### `:undo` takes back a line, whether or not you are proving

*Decided 2026-08-29.*

A session always has a development — at a fresh prompt you are standing in a
scratch one with a single hole called `goal`. You can build in it: `assume`,
`claim`, `:goal`, tactics, `certify`, all with no `:theorem` open.

**`:undo` works there, and so does the rewind that undoes a failed line.** Both
used to require a proof, which was an accident of where the undo stack was
stored rather than a decision.

**`:undo` does not cross a proof boundary.** `:theorem`, `qed`, `:abandon`,
`:suspend` and `:resume` each start a fresh history:

```
assume A : Type₀
:theorem t : Type₀
:undo                  nothing to undo — it will not step back past :theorem
```

**Why `qed` in particular:** admitting a theorem writes it into the global
environment, and the environment is not part of what `:undo` restores — it only
ever grows. An `:undo` across a `qed` would rewind your development and leave the
theorem admitted, which is worse than refusing.

**Loading a file leaves no undo history**, for the same reason: a file declares
datatypes and admits theorems, and neither is something `:undo` could honestly
reverse.
